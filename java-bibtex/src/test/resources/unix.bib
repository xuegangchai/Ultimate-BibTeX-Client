                 a system for typesetting mathematics.\par

                 The language has been designed to be easy to learn and
                 to use by people (for example, secretaries and
                 mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
                 typesetting. Experience indicates that the language can
                 be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and
                 fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and
                 font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like
                 necessary to print according to mathematical
                 conventions are all done automatically. For example,
                 the input {\tt sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i=pi over
                 2} produces $\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i = \pi/2$. The syntax
                 of the language is specified by a small context-free
                 grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler
                 that translates this language into typesetting
                 commands. Output maybe produced on either a
                 phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and
                 reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces
                 directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of
                 text and mathematics may be handled simply. This paper
                 was typeset by the authors using the system
                 described.",

                 generator based upon the linear congruential algorithm
                 and 48-bit integer arithmetic. The {\tt drand48}
                 subroutine is callable from C-language programs and is
                 available in the subroutine library of the UNIX
                 operating system. Versions coded in assembly language
                 now exist for both the PDP-11 and VAX-11 computers; a
                 version coded in a ``portable'' dialect of C language
                 has been produced by Rosler for the Western Electric
                 3B20 and other machines. Given the same initialization
                 value, all these versions produce the identical
                 sequence of pseudo-random numbers. Versions of {\tt
                 drand48} in the assembly language of other computers or
                 for other programming languages clearly could be
                 implemented, and some output results have been
                 tabulated to aid in testing and debugging such newly
                 coded subroutines. Timing results for {\tt drand48} on
                 the PDP-11/ 45, the PDP-11/70, the VAX-11/750, and the
                 VAX-11/78O are also presented and compared.",

  remark =       "This paper describes the {\tt drand48()} generator
                 family, which is widely implemented on Unix systems,
                 and is standardized in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, {\em
                 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)}.
                 Curiously, this paper is not mentioned in that
                 Standard, or in 1997-vintage FreeBSD source code for
                 this family, or in current Unix manual pages for {\tt
                 drand48()}.\par

                 The {\tt drand48()} code uses a standard linear
                 congruential generator, defined by $X_{n + 1} = (a X_n
                 + c) \bmod m$, with $n \geq 0$, $a = 0x5\,deec\,e66d =
                 0o273\,673\,163\,155 = 25\,214\,903\,917$, $c = 0xb =
                 0o13 = 11$, and $m = 2^{48}$, giving a period of
                 $2^{48} = 281\,474\,976\,710\,656$. Timing tests using
                 a C {\tt main()} program given in the paper, with
                 hand-coded assembly-language library implementations of
                 the generator on five PDP-11 and VAX models showed
                 times from 440 sec (PDP-11/45) to 96 sec (VAX-11/780)
                 for $10^6$ output pseudorandom numbers.

                 Timing tests using the program in this paper on
                 2010-vintage AMD and Intel x86\_64 CPUs show a speedup
                 of about 2400 times over the best 1977-vintage
                 VAX-11/780 times, suggesting that the period of the
                 {\tt drand48()} generator could be reached in about
                 three months. There are well-understood, and
                 unavoidable, $n$-step correlations (for some, possibly
                 large, and possibly as-yet-unknown, $n$) in linear
                 congruential generators, as discovered by George
                 Marsaglia and described in his famous paper ``Random
                 numbers fall mainly in the planes'' (Proceedings of the
                 National Academy of Science of the USA, {\bf 61}(1)
                 25--28, 15 September 1968). The availability of other
                 generator families developed since about 1990 that have
                 much larger periods (up to $10^{100}$ to $10^{20000}$),
                 and no known $n$-step correlations, suggest that {\tt
                 drand48()} should not be used for serious long-running
                 simulations, even though it is likely to still be
                 satisfactory for casual use.",

                 First a hierarchical file organization based on a
                 linear ordering of records is presented for retrieving
                 records highly similar to any input query. Then the

                 hierarchical file for a set of strings in a dictionary
                 of English words. The spelling correction steps proceed
                 as follows: (1) find one of the best-match strings
                 which are most similar to a query, (2) expand the
                 search area for obtaining the good-match strings, and
                 (3) interrupt the file search as soon as the required
                 string is displayed. Computational experiments verify

                 some general porting considerations, and shows how some
                 of the ideas were used in actual UNIX operating system
                 porting efforts. Discussions of the efforts associated
                 with porting the UNIX operating system to an Intel

                 performing table searches, disk input/output, and
                 terminal handling; these have been driven heavily by
                 the release from address space and memory restrictions
                 in recent 32-bit hardware. Overall, the changes on
                 32-bit machines have yielded a more than 25-percent

                 operating system for IBM System/370 computers. In this
                 implementation an underlying Resident Supervisor,
                 adapted from an existing IBM control program, provides
                 machine control and multiprogramming; while a UNIX
                 System Supervisor, adapted from the standard UNIX
                 system kernel, provides the UNIX system environment.
                 This implementation supports multiprocessing, paging,
                 and large-process, virtual address spaces. Terminal
                 handling is done through an outboard terminal
                 processor. This paper describes the software structure,
                 with emphasis on unique aspects of this implementation:
                 multiprocessing and process synchronization, process
                 creation, and outboard terminal handling. Capacity and
                 performance of the UNIX system on large mainframes is

                 disks is proposed. A detailed queueing network model is
                 constructed for several file distributions in secondary
                 storage. The interdependencies between the speed of the
                 CPU, the swapping activity, the visit ratios and the
                 multiprogramming level are examined and included in the
                 modeling technique. The models predict the performance
                 of several possible file assignments. The various file
                 assignments are implemented and comparisons between the
                 predicted and actual performance are made. The models
                 are shown to accurately predict user response time.",

                 novel integration mechanisms; they are the subject of
                 this paper. We discuss Cedar from the viewpoint of a
                 tool developer, discussing both `rights' and
                 `responsibilities'; in building a new tool. We describe
                 integration in Cedar from the `ground up'. First, we
                 discuss the Cedar programming language and its effect
                 on integration; the main point here is that in Cedar,
                 one finds little `code stealing' and a lot of `code
                 sharing'. Then we discuss Cedar packages; the key point
                 here is that programmer's interfaces are just as
                 important as the user's interface. Finally, we discuss
                 the Cedar file system, FS, and the degree to which FS
                 makes it easy to manage large numbers of files.",

                 3BSD, the forthcoming system from the University of
                 California at Berkeley. We trace the historical
                 development of the UNIX system from its conception in
                 1969 until today, and describe the design principles
                 that have guided this development. We then present the
                 internal data structures and algorithms used by the
                 kernel to support the user interface. In particular, we
                 describe process management, memory management, the
                 file system, the I/O system, and communications. We
                 conclude with a brief description of the user interface

  abstract =     "UNIX is a disk-based operating system, where only the
                 system kernel is always memory-resident. A combination
                 of small block size, limited read-ahead and numerous
                 seeks can severely limit the file system throughput.
                 This paper presents a tool to study the file access
                 patterns. Information derived from the data collected
                 can be used to determine the optimal disk block size
                 and also to improve the block placement strategy. The
                 tool is a software monitor, installed at the device
                 driver level, and triggered by every physical request
                 to the disk handler. The design approach used to
                 measure the average number of logical records accessed
                 sequentially is described. An evaluation of the tool is
                 also presented.",

                 operating system is described, with the focus on the
                 key design issues. This interface provides several
                 extensions beyond the I/O interface of UNIX, including
                 support for record I/O, locking, atomic transactions,
                 and replication, as well as attributes that indicate
                 whether optional semantics and operations are
                 available. Experience in using and implementing this
                 interface with a variety of different I/O services is
                 described, along with the performance of both local and
                 network I/O. It is concluded that the UIO interface
                 provides a uniform I/O system interface with
                 significant functionality, wide applicability, and no
                 significant performance penalty.",

                 fragmentation is described. Files are allocated on up
                 to t extents, and inoptimally allocated files are
                 periodically reallocated. The Dartmouth Time-Sharing
                 System (DTSS) uses this method. Several installations,
                 representing different classes of workload are studied
                 to measure the method's performance. The results
                 indicate that compared to the file layout method used
                 by UNIX, the buddy system results in more efficient
                 access but less efficient utilization of disk space. As
                 disks become larger and less expensive per byte,
                 strategies that achieve efficient I/O throughput at the
                 expense of some storage loss become increasingly

  abstract =     "In the UNIX operating system, the kernel assumes that
                 the file system is always maintained in known correct
                 state. Should the kernel ever detect a variation from
                 that state, a system panic occurs, and the system
                 `crashes'. For this reason it is important that the
                 integrity of the file system be checked before bringing
                 any UNIX system up in multi-user mode. A file system
                 check program called fsck is supplied with UNIX (unless
                 otherwise specified UNIX refers to the BSD version
                 family), and is designed to find any errors in the
                 state of the file system and fix them, if possible, to
                 prevent system panics. Unfortunately, on a system with
                 a relatively large amount of mounted disk storage, the
                 time it takes to run fsck can become a very significant
                 percentage of system boot time. When working in a
                 system development environment where the system will
                 probably have to be booted frequently, the (highly
                 desirable) use of fsck can begin to waste valuable work
                 time. In an attempt to solve this problem, fsck was
                 studied in detail, and then modified to perform its
                 tasks more efficiently. This paper first describes the
                 function of the original fsck program to convey the
                 basic goals it sets out to accomplish. The next section
                 points out inefficiencies that were found in the
                 original algorithms, and describes how these
                 inefficiencies were alleviated. A number of timing
                 measurements were taken to locate the original
                 problems, and then later to show that the modifications
                 did provide significant improvement. Our new fsck was
                 tested to ensure it retained all the diagnostic and
                 corrective capabilities of the original. It was also
                 ported to a different machine to demonstrate its
                 general usefulness in any BSD based UNIX environment.
                 Compared to the version of fsck distributed with BSD
                 4.2 or 4.3, our fsck consistently runs 2 to 3 times
                 faster, and reboot times (with file system checks) have
                 been cut almost in half. Real time measurements for our
                 fsck on the three machines where it has been installed
                 are given in the concluding section.",

                 software can be difficult, because environments for
                 developing expert systems typically are not compatible
                 with traditional software-engineering technology. To
                 deal with this problem, we are developing CEST, a
                 C-language expert system toolset. It is a library of
                 inference engines implemented as C functions that can
                 be called from C programs --- and a workbench of
                 knowledge-engineering support tools. CEST allows easy
                 integration of expert system components into C-based
                 software systems, and provides knowledge-engineering
                 support tools analogous to traditional
                 software-engineering support tools. The first tool
                 written for CEST is AVIEN, a backward-chaining
                 attribute-value inference engine. It has been widely
                 distributed within AT\&T, and has been used to build
                 both stand-alone expert systems and C-based hybrid
                 systems. In particular, the Quality Assurance Center at
                 AT\&T Bell Laboratories is using AVIEN in software

                 environment in use in the Computer Science Laboratory
                 at Xerox PARC since 1980. The Cedar language is a
                 superset of Mesa, the major additions being garbage
                 collection and runtime types. Neither the language nor
                 the environment was originally intended to be portable,
                 and for many years ran only on D-machines at PARC and a
                 few other locations in Xerox. We recently
                 re-implemented the language to make it portable across
                 many different architectures. We present a brief
                 description of the Cedar language, our portability
                 strategy for the compiler and runtime, our manner of
                 making connections to other languages and the Unix
                 operating system, and some measures of the performance
                 of our `Portable Cedar'.",

                 version of UNIX based on three-way atomic message
                 transmission was presented in an earlier paper. This
                 paper describes the working system, now known as the
                 TARGON\slash 32. The original design left open
                 questions in at least two areas: fault tolerance for
                 server processes and recovery after a crash were
                 briefly and inaccurately sketched; rebackup after
                 recovery was not discussed at all. The fundamental
                 design involving three-way message transmission has
                 remained unchanged. However, server backup has been
                 redesigned and is now more consistent with that of
                 normal user processes. Recovery and rebackup have been
                 completed in a less centralized and thus more efficient
                 manner. We review important aspects of the original
                 design and note how the implementation differs from our
                 original ideas. We then focus on the backup and
                 recovery for server processes and the changes and
                 additions in the design and implementation of recovery
                 and rebackup.",

                 functionally-defined data and uses techniques based on
                 attributed graphs to optimize the maintenance of
                 functionally-defined data. The implementation is
                 self-adaptive in that the physical organization and the
                 update algorithms dynamically change in order to reduce
                 disk access. The system is also concurrent. At any
                 given time there are some number of computations that
                 must be performed to bring the database up to date;
                 these computations are scheduled independently and are
                 performed when the expected cost to do so is minimal.
                 The DBMS runs in the Unix/C Sun workstation
                 environment. Cactis is designed to support applications
                 that require rich data modeling capabilities and the
                 ability to specify functionally-defined data, but that
                 also demand good performance. Specifically, Cactis is

                 VLSI and PCB design, and software environments.",

                 with the function body. With automatic inline function
                 expansion, programs can be constructed with many small
                 functions to handle complexity and then rely on the
                 compilation to eliminate most of the function calls.
                 Therefore, inline expansion serves a tool for
                 satisfying two conflicting goals: minimizing the
                 complexity of the program development and minimizing
                 the function call overhead of program execution. A
                 simple inline expansion procedure is presented which
                 uses profile information to address three critical
                 issues: code expansion, stack expansion, and
                 unavailable function bodies. Experiments show that a
                 large percentage of function calls\slash returns (about

                 implementation of interprocess communication which does
                 not require modifications to the operating system. The
                 IPC facility described supports communication between
                 arbitrary processes even on systems, such as vanilla
                 Unix V, which normally restrict communication to
                 parent\slash child or sibling process pairs.
                 Interprocess channels are dynamically allocated, and no
                 system configuration or other static specification is
                 required. The implementation embeds a server registry
                 facility to help clients find the IPC channels for
                 servers. A library of C functions supports the
                 creation, allocation, deallocation and maintenance of
                 IPC channels, the registering, unregistering and
                 searching for servers, and a general packet
                 communication protocol for use between processes using
                 IPC. While described in the context of Unix, the
                 mechanism generalizes to any operating system which
                 supports the `pipe' or `core file' concept.",

  abstract =     "Andrew is a distributed computing environment that is
                 a synthesis of the personal computing and timesharing
                 paradigms. When mature, it is expected to encompass
                 over 5,000 workstations spanning the Carnegie Mellon
                 University campus. This paper examines the security
                 issues that arise in such an environment and describes
                 the mechanisms that have been developed to address
                 them. These mechanisms include the logical and physical
                 separation of servers and clients, support for secure
                 communication at the remote procedure call level, a
                 distributed authentication service, a file-protection
                 scheme that combines access lists with UNIX mode bits,
                 and the use of encryption as a basic building block.
                 The paper also discusses the assumptions underlying
                 security in Andrew and analyzes the vulnerability of
                 the system. Usage experience reveals that resource
                 control, particularly of workstation CPU cycles, is
                 more important than originally anticipated and that the
                 mechanisms available to address this issue are
                 rudimentary.",

                 object-oriented database system and environment. It is
                 intended for users who do not want to write programs in
                 Ode's database programming language O++ to interact
                 with Ode but instead want to use a friendlier interface
                 to Ode. OdeView is based on the graphical direct
                 manipulation paradigm that involves selection of items
                 from pop-up menus and icons that can be clicked on the
                 dragged. OdeView provides facilities for examining the
                 database schema examining class definitions, browsing
                 objects, following chains of references, displaying
                 selected portions of objects or selecting a subset of
                 the ways in which an object can be displayed
                 (projection), and retrieving specific objects
                 (selection). OdeView is implemented using X-Windows and
                 HP-Widgets on a SUN workstation running the UNIX
                 system. The video takes the viewers on a tour of
                 OdeView, showing how a user interacts with OdeView to
                 examine the database schema and the objects in the

                 separate file system (subtree) of the file name
                 hierarchy occupies a logical disk volume, composed of
                 space from possibly several disks. Database memory (a
                 variant of virtual memory) and other database
                 techniques are used to manage file system meta-data.
                 These features provide the capacity to address large
                 applications and many users, simplified program access
                 to file data, efficient file buffering in memory,

                 can be accessed by the user via pop up menus. The

                 mathematical software, but its principles are
                 sufficiently general to allow it (with some
                 modification) to be used for any type of directory
                 browsing. The browser is implemented with the X Window
                 system and Motif. We first present a manual of

                 program components represent changes, and classifying

  abstract =     "The purpose of a distributed file system (DFS) is to
                 allow users of physically distributed computers to
                 share data and storage resources by using a common file
                 system. A typical configuration for a DFS is a
                 collection of workstations and mainframes connected by
                 a local area network (LAN). A DFS is implemented as
                 part of the operating system of each of the connected
                 computers. This paper establishes a viewpoint that
                 emphasizes the dispersed structure and decentralization
                 of both data and control in the design of such systems.
                 It defines the concepts of transparency, fault
                 tolerance, and scalability and discusses them in the
                 context of DFSs. The paper claims that the principle of
                 distributed operation is fundamental for a fault
                 tolerant and scalable DFS design. It also presents
                 alternatives for the semantics of sharing and methods
                 for providing access to remote files. A survey of
                 contemporary UNIX-based systems, namely, UNIX United,
                 Locus, Sprite, Sun's Network File System, and ITC's
                 Andrew, illustrates the concepts and demonstrates
                 various implementations and design alternatives. Based
                 on the assessment of these systems, the paper makes the
                 point that a departure from the approach of extending
                 centralized file systems over a communication network
                 is necessary to accomplish sound distributed file
                 system design.",

                 random input streams are fed into important UNIX

                 cases, the tests were able to crash the entire
                 operating system. In 1995, a (sadly, unpublished)
                 followup study showed that many of the failures
                 diagnosed in 1990 still had not been repaired in the
                 commercial systems, and that the GNU implementations
                 were generally more robust. Both 1990 and 1995 papers,

                 University (VU) and the Centre for Mathematics and
                 Computer Science (CWI), both in Amsterdam. Throughout
                 the project's ten-year history, a major concern of the
                 designers has been to combine the research themes of
                 distributed systems, such as high availability, use of
                 parallelism and scalability, with simplicity and high
                 performance. Distributed systems are necessarily more
                 complicated than centralized systems, so they have a
                 tendency to be much slower. Amoeba was always designed
                 to be used, so it was deemed essential to achieve
                 extremely high performance. The Amoeba software is
                 based on objects. An objects is a piece of data on
                 which well-defined operations may be performed by
                 authorized users, independent of where the user and
                 object are located. Objects are managed by server
                 processes and named using capabilities chosen randomly
                 from a sparse name space. Processes consist of a
                 segmented address space shared by one or more threads
                 of control. Processes can be created, managed, and
                 debugged remotely. Operations on objects are
                 implemented using remote procedure calls. Amoeba has a
                 unique and fast file system. The file system is split
                 into two parts --- the Bullet Service, which stores
                 immutable files contiguously on the disk and the SOAP
                 Directory Service, which provides a mechanism for
                 giving capabilities symbolic names. The directory
                 server also handles replication and atomicity,
                 eliminating the need for a separate transaction
                 management system.",

                 versions of UNIX by recording traces of paging activity
                 over time and writing programs to analyze the traces.
                 We recorded periodic totals of paging events instead of
                 individual paging events themselves. Our analysis shows
                 that paging activity accounts for between 15\% and 21\%
                 of all disk block accesses. Average paging system
                 traffic is very low. The paging system is idle most of
                 the time and paging activity occurs in large periodic
                 bursts. Despite the fact that it is often overlooked,
                 swap related paging accounts for a significant portion
                 of all paging activity (between 24\% and 71\%).
                 Furthermore, the behavior of swap-related paging
                 differs greatly from the well-studied behavior of
                 demand paging. The ratio of pages read to pages written
                 (which varies between 0.85 and 1.9) is lower than
                 typical read to write ratios for file system accesses.
                 Paging activity is loosely correlated with load average
                 or number of users.",

                 STAR 2000 system, a high-performance real-time computer
                 for telemetry applications. The REAL\slash STAR 2000 is
                 a symmetric, tightly-coupled multiprocessor, optimized
                 for real-time processing. The system provides a high
                 level of scalability and flexibility by supporting
                 three configurations: single, dual, and quad processor
                 configurations, based on Motorola 88100 RISC
                 processors. The system runs the multiprocessor
                 REAL\slash IX operating system, a real-time
                 implementation of the AT\&T UNIX System V. It compiles
                 with BCS and OCS standards, meets the POSIX 1003.1
                 standard, and has the current functionality of the
                 emerging POSIX 1003.4 real-time standard. The
                 REAL\slash STAR 2000 promotes an open system approach
                 to real-time computing by supporting major industry

                 for Allegro CL (an implementation of Common Lisp) and
                 the relational database management system TransBase.
                 The interface and its components are presently running
                 on SUN UNIX workstations but can easily be installed on
                 all major UNIX workstations. CL/TB supports data
                 manipulation, data definition, and data control. The
                 database system is called by sending SQL- statements as
                 strings from Allegro CL. Basically, CL/TB offers the
                 prominent services of the underlying TransBase
                 programming interface (TBX). The services are
                 successfully integrated into the functional environment
                 of Lisp and enhanced by many additional features to
                 improve ease of use, programming security, and error
                 support. Thus operating on a database system via CL/TB
                 is easy even for unexperienced users. Furthermore CL/TB
                 is compatible with the relational algebra R-Lisp. The
                 first part of this paper is concerned with aspects of
                 structure, design, implementation, and with performance
                 evaluation. The second part gives a defining
                 description of the interface's functions and is
                 intended to be a user guide.",

                 analyze it. In doing so, we were interested in

                 1. What is the magnitude of paging traffic and how much
                 of I/O system activity is paging related?\par

                 how can paging system implementations be tuned to match
                 them?\par

                 cross-references between object modules and run-time
                 libraries to produce a stand-alone executable image.
                 Because most program changes only involve a small part
                 of the program, we have implemented an incremental
                 linker, named Inclink, that processes only the changed
                 modules. Inclink generates a new executable in time
                 proportional to the size of change; in contrast, a
                 batch linker generates an executable in time
                 proportional to the size of the program. To minimize
                 updates to the executable, Inclink allocates extra
                 space for every module. By allocating 24 percent more
                 space in the executable for overflows, Inclink can
                 update a module in place over 97 percent of the time.
                 Measurements show that Inclink is more than an order of
                 magnitude faster than the UNIX [2] batch linker and
                 that 88 percent of all links will take less than 2~s of

                 system we designed, based on typological studies of
                 major-language writing conventions, unifies common
                 features of such conventions to enable international
                 and local utilization. The internationalization layer
                 input module converts keystroke sequences to phonograms
                 and ideograms. The corresponding output module displays
                 position-independent and dependent characters. The
                 localization layer positions language-specific
                 functions outside the structure, integrating them as
                 tables used by finite automaton interpreters and
                 servers to add new languages and code sets without
                 recompilation. The I/O system generates and displays
                 stateful and stateless code sets, enabling interactive
                 language switching. Going beyond POSIX locale model
                 bounds, the system generates ISO 2022, ISO\slash DIS
                 10646 (1990), and Compound Text, defined for the
                 interchange encoding format in X11 protocols, for basic
                 polyglot text communication and processing. Able to
                 generate multilingual code sets, the I/O system clearly
                 demonstrates that code sets should be selected by
                 applications which have purposes beyond selecting one
                 element from a localization set. Functionality and
                 functions related to text manipulation in an operating
                 system (OS) must also be determined by such
                 applications. A subset of this I/O system was
                 implemented in the X window system as a basic use of
                 X11R5 I/O by supplying basic code set generation and
                 string manipulation to eliminate OS interference. To
                 ensure polyglot string manipulation, the I/O system
                 must clearly be implemented separately from an OS and
                 its limitations.",

  abstract =     "In recent years, the computer science community has
                 realized the advantages of GUIs (Graphical User
                 Interfaces). Because high-quality GUIs are difficult to
                 build, support tools such as UIMSs, UI Toolkits, and
                 Interface Builders have been developed. Although these
                 tools are powerful, they typically make two
                 assumptions: first, that the programmer has some
                 familiarity with the GUI model, and second, that he is
                 willing to invest several weeks becoming proficient
                 with the tool. These tools typically operate only on
                 specific platforms, such as DOS, the Macintosh, or
                 UNIX/X-windows. The existing tools are beyond the reach
                 of most undergraduate computer science majors, or
                 professional programmers who wish to quickly build GUIs
                 without investing the time to become specialists in GUI
                 design. For this class of users, we developed SUIT, the
                 Simple User Interface Toolkit. SUIT is an attempt to
                 distill the fundamental components of an interface
                 builder and GUI toolkit, and to explain those concepts
                 with the tool itself, all in a short period of time. We
                 have measured that college juniors with no previous GUI
                 programming experience can use SUIT productively after
                 less than three hours. SUIT is a C subroutine library
                 which provides an external control UIMS, an interactive
                 layout editor, and a set of standard `widgets,' such as
                 sliders, buttons, and check boxes. SUIT-based
                 applications run transparently across the Macintosh,
                 DOS, and UNIX/X platforms. SUIT has been exported to
                 hundreds of external sites on the Internet. This paper
                 describes SUIT's architecture, the design decisions we
                 made during its development, and the lessons we learned
                 from extensive observations of over 120 users.",

                 management called a {\em log-structured file system}. A
                 log-structured file system writes all modifications to
                 disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby
                 speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The
                 log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing
                 information so that files can be read back from the log
                 efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on
                 disk for fast writing, we divide the log into{\em
                 segments\/}and use a {\em segment cleaner\/} to
                 compress the live information from heavily fragmented
                 segments. We present a series of simulations that
                 demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy
                 based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a
                 prototype log-structured file system called Sprite LFS;
                 it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of
                 magnitude for small-file writes while matching or
                 exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes.
                 Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite
                 LFS can use 70\% of the disk bandwidth for writing,
                 whereas Unix file systems typically can use only
                 5-10\%.",

                 with numeric computing is to automatically derive and
                 produce numeric code. This approach has important
                 applications in science and engineering. Once the
                 desired formulas and procedures are derived in a
                 symbolic manipulation system, they can be translated
                 into a target numeric language by a {\em code
                 generator}. GENCRAY is a code generator written in the
                 C language for portability. GENCRAY defines a
                 LISP-style input language that is translated into
                 either FORTRAN 77 or CRAY FORTRAN. By defining its own
                 input syntax, GENCRAY becomes a free-standing code
                 translator that can be made to work with any symbolic
                 manipulation system. GENCRAY is portable to any
                 computer system with a standard C compiler. Input to
                 GENCRAY can come from a file or directly from a
                 symbolic system through a pipe. On UNIX systems with
                 Berkeley networking, GENCRAY also runs as a network
                 server. The input syntax is customizable to allow both

                 generating easily vectorizable CRAY FORTRAN code,
                 GENCRAY also provides high-level, easy-to-use parallel
                 programming macros to produce parallel code for the
                 multiprocessor CRAY systems. The features,

                 described. Techniques for producing parallel codes are

  abstract =     "Given a program {\em Base\/} and two variants, {\em
                 A\/} and {\em B}, each created by modifying separate
                 copies of {\em Base}, the goal of program integration
                 is to determine whether the modifications interfere,
                 and if they do not, to create an integrated program
                 that includes both sets of changes as well as the
                 portions of {\em Base\/} preserved in both variants.
                 Text-based integration techniques, such as the one used
                 by the Unix {\em diff 3\/} utility, are obviously
                 unsatisfactory because one has no guarantees about how
                 the execution behavior of the integrated program
                 relates to the behaviors of {\em Base}, {\em A}, and
                 {\em B}. The first program-integration algorithm to
                 provide such guarantees was developed by Horwitz et
                 al.[13]. However, a limitation of that algorithm is
                 that it incorporates no notion of semantics-preserving
                 transformations. This limitation causes the algorithm
                 to be overly conservative in its definition of
                 interference. For example, if one variant changes the
                 {\em way\/} a computation is performed (without
                 changing the values computed) while the other variant
                 adds code that uses the result of the computation, the
                 algorithm would classify those changes as interfering.
                 This paper describes a new integration algorithm that
                 is able to accommodate semantics-preserving
                 transformations.",

                 environment is a collection of heterogeneous software

                 of IBM mainframes and workstations that are scattered
                 to different countries leading to the subsequent rise
                 in self-controlled or autonomous computing services.
                 However, problems still exist in such environments. In
                 response, the Purdue University's InterBase Lab
                 designed an environment for global application. They
                 call it InterBase (BCD + 92), which maintains a
                 toll-based interface that facilitates application
                 development in a distributed environment of
                 heterogeneous software. BNR has foreseen the
                 realization of two major benefits. These are: cost

  abstract =     "An important issue that affects response time
                 performance in current OODB and hypertext systems is
                 the I/O involved in moving objects from slow memory to
                 cache. A promising way to tackle this problem is to use
                 prefetching, in which we predict the user's next page
                 requests and get those pages into cache in the
                 background. Current databases perform limited
                 prefetching using techniques derived from older virtual
                 memory systems. A novel idea of using data compression
                 techniques for prefetching was recently advocated in
                 [KrV, ViK], in which prefetchers based on the
                 Lempel--Ziv data compressor (the UNIX compress command)
                 were shown theoretically to be optimal in the limit. In
                 this paper we analyze the practical aspects of using
                 data compression techniques for prefetching. We adapt
                 three well-known data compressors to get three simple,
                 deterministic, and universal prefetchers. We simulate
                 our prefetchers on sequences of page accesses derived
                 from the OO1 and OO7 benchmarks and from CAD
                 applications, and demonstrate significant reductions in
                 fault-rate. We examine the important issues of cache
                 replacement, size of the data structure used by the
                 prefetcher, and problems arising from bursts of `fast'
                 page requests (that leave virtually no time between
                 adjacent requests for prefetching and book keeping). We
                 conclude that prediction for prefetching based on data
                 compression techniques holds great promise.",

                 guidelines for creating test methods in an informal,

                 emerging standards must have 1003.3 style test methods
                 written for them before they could ge submitted for
                 approval as a POSIX standard. Soon after this

                 are determined to make Windows NT the unquestioned
                 leader in distributed computing. NT is built from the
                 ground up as a networking platform, with built-in file
                 and print sharing. APIs, and support for TCP/IP and

                 NT-conform to an existing standard (Posix) and to
                 define an SNMP management information base for it. But

                 server designed to accelerate Fortran and C programs in
                 a UNIX environment. It can run complete programs in a
                 simple shared memory environment, including support for
                 UNIX systems calls. A very efficient HiPPI interface
                 makes the CRAY APP cluster-capable and well-suited to
                 interact with other programs running on a network in a
                 client\slash server mode. Several novel features of the
                 CRAY APP system design and programming environment
                 allow for simple porting and incremental tuning of
                 existing applications. These include a highly efficient
                 microkernel operating system, low overhead
                 library-based parallel support software, and a simple
                 refinement to existing vectorization techniques called
                 data vectorization. This paper discusses parallel
                 programming on the CRAY APP, the system features that
                 make the programming environment possible, and some
                 examples of complete applications that have sustained

                 designing an application's user interface. The

                 displays, including real-time, data-driven display
                 objects. Users can define context-sensitive help for a
                 target application. They can rehearse the user
                 interface and also generate code automatically. In
                 addition, TAE Plus contains application services for

                 and UNIX System Laboratories for the development of
                 standard performance measurement interfaces to the UNIX
                 System. Requirements will be based on the collective,
                 non-vendor specific needs for a standard performance
                 architecture. Currently the lack of this standard
                 causes undue porting and kernel additions by each UNIX
                 System vendor as well as a great variety of approaches
                 to gain the same basic performance insight into the
                 system. Building tools to monitor, display, model, or
                 predict performance or its trends is a frustrating and
                 currently single vendor enterprise. By providing
                 standard data structures, types of performance data
                 gathered, and a common kernel interface to collect this
                 data, the whole UNIX system vendor community along with
                 the UNIX software vendors can develop performance tools
                 which last more than one UNIX release and work on
                 multiple UNIX platforms.",

  abstract =     "Several cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors
                 have been developed that are scalable and offer a very
                 tight coupling between the processing resources. They
                 are therefore quite attractive for use as compute
                 servers for multiprogramming and parallel application
                 workloads. Process scheduling and memory management,
                 however, remain challenging due to the distributed main
                 memory found on such machines. This paper examines the
                 effects of OS scheduling and page migration policies on
                 the performance of such compute servers. Our
                 experiments are done on the Stanford DASH, a
                 distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor. We
                 show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting
                 of sequential jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling
                 policy does very poorly. In contrast, a policy
                 incorporating cluster and cache affinity along with a
                 simple page-migration algorithm offers up to two-fold
                 performance improvement. For our workloads consisting
                 of multiple parallel applications, we compare
                 space-sharing policies that divide the processors among
                 the applications to time-slicing policies such as
                 standard Unix or gang scheduling. We show that
                 space-sharing policies can achieve better processor
                 utilization due to the operating point effect, but
                 time-slicing policies benefit strongly from user-level
                 data distribution. Our initial experience with
                 automatic page migration suggests that policies based
                 only on TLB miss information can be quite effective,
                 and useful for addressing the data distribution
                 problems of space-sharing schedulers.",

                 support in Opal, a single-address-space operating
                 system designed for wide-address (64-bit)
                 architectures. Opal threads execute within protection
                 domains in a single shared virtual address space.
                 Sharing is simplified, because addresses are context
                 independent. There is no loss of protection, because
                 addressability and access are independent; the right to
                 access a segment is determined by the protection domain
                 in which a thread executes. This model enables
                 beneficial code-and data-sharing patterns that are
                 currently prohibitive, due in part to the inherent
                 restrictions of multiple address spaces, and in part to
                 Unix programming style. We have designed and
                 implemented an Opal prototype using the Mach 3.0
                 microkernel as a base. Our implementation demonstrates
                 how a single-address-space structure can be supported
                 alongside of other environments on a modern microkernel
                 operating system, using modern wide-address
                 architectures. This article justifies the Opal model
                 and its goals for sharing and protection, presents the
                 system and its abstractions, describes the prototype
                 implementation, and reports experience with integrated

                 Clemson Automated Testing System (CATS), has
                 demonstrated the value of integrating formalized test
                 methods within all phases of standards development.
                 IEEE's effort to develop a standard for operating
                 systems interfaces (POSIX) has provided a working
                 environment to investigate and evaluate the
                 capabilities of CATS. In this arena, CATS has proven
                 valuable in exposing critical issues in the emerging
                 standard and in formulating feasible solutions on
                 multiple occasions. The role of CATS in the areas of
                 automated testing, profile development and real-time
                 extensions is described. A discussion of future for
                 CATS and testing in open system standards concludes the

                 specification of the forthcoming POSIX .21 standard
                 `Real-Time Distributed Systems Communications.' This
                 exercise was conducted by a relative novice in formal
                 methods who did not have significant POSIX domain
                 knowledge. With the assistance of both formal methods
                 experts and domain specialists, the formal
                 specification activity raised a number of issues early
                 in the evolution of the standard. Resolution of these
                 issues by the domain specialists will lead to an
                 improved standard, whether or not the formal
                 specification is included in the standard. In this
                 paper, we present a classification and analysis of the
                 types of issues raised using our formal approach. Our

                 a virtual address space on which transactional
                 guarantees are offered. This article describes RVM, an
                 efficient, portable, and easily used implementation of
                 recoverable virtual memory for Unix environments. A
                 unique characteristic of RVM is that it allows
                 independent control over the transactional properties
                 of atomicity, permanence, and serializability. This
                 leads to considerable flexibility in the use of RVM,
                 potentially enlarging the range of applications that
                 can benefit from transactions. It also simplifies the
                 layering of functionality such as nesting and
                 distribution. The article shows that RVM performs well
                 over its intended range of usage even though it does
                 not benefit from specialized operating system support.
                 It also demonstrates the importance of intra- and
                 inter-transaction optimizations.",

                 tool developed within the TLTP Interact Project which
                 allows application programs, concurrently executing
                 within a Unix environment, to be controlled by scripts
                 delivered to Mosaic from W3 servers. This tool was
                 developed to allow the coupling of interactive
                 simulations of scientific and engineering phenomena
                 with courseware provided by W3. This software is known
                 as the Interact Communication Facility (ICF). The
                 features of the ICF include the ability to allow
                 application programs to receive control messages and
                 data from scripts embedded as links within HTML
                 documents; the use of HTML fill-out forms to enter data
                 intended for application programs; a simple interface
                 to allow programs to control Mosaic, including the
                 automatic execution of Mosaic if it is not currently
                 being used, a means of allowing secure execution of
                 applications from scripts. This avoids the security
                 problems associated with allowing Mosaic to interpret
                 arbitrary shell scripts. This paper provides an
                 overview of the ICF together with an example showing
                 the use of Mosaic in conjunction with a simple
                 graphical program.",

                 cut substantially by copying only a small number of
                 blocks using this technique. The technique has been

  abstract =     "Given a program Base and two variants, A and B, each
                 created by modifying separate copies of Base, the goal
                 of program integration is to determine whether the
                 modifications interfere, and if they do not, to create
                 an integrated program that incorporates both sets of
                 changes as well as the portions of Base preserved in
                 both variants. Text-based integration techniques, such
                 as the one used by the Unix {\em diff3\/} utility, are
                 obviously unsatisfactory because one has no guarantees
                 about how the execution behavior of the integrated
                 program relates to the behaviors of Base, A, and B. The
                 first program integration algorithm to provide such
                 guarantees was developed by Horwitz, Prins, and Reps.
                 However, a limitation of that algorithm is that it only
                 applied to programs written in a restricted
                 language--in particular, the algorithm does not handle
                 programs with procedures. This article describes a
                 generalization of the Horwitz-Prins-Reps algorithm that
                 handles programs that consist of multiple (and possibly
                 mutually recursive) procedures. \par

                 We show that two straightforward generalizations of the
                 Horwitz-Prins-Reps algorithm yield unsatisfactory
                 results. The key issue in developing a satisfactory
                 algorithm is how to take into account different calling
                 contexts when determining what has changed in the
                 variants A and B. Our solution to this problem involves
                 identifying two different kinds of affected components
                 of A and B: those affected regardless of how the
                 procedure is called, and those affected by a changed or
                 new calling context. The algorithm makes use of
                 interprocedural program slicing to identify these
                 components, as well as components in Base, A, and B
                 with the same behavior.",

                 of UNIX SVR4 on a large shared-memory multiprocessor
                 and analyzes the effects of possible OS and
                 architectural changes. We use a nonintrusive cache miss
                 monitor to trace the execution of an OS-intensive
                 multiprogrammed workload on the Stanford DASH, a 32-CPU
                 CC-NUMA multiprocessor (CC-NUMA multiprocessors have
                 cache-coherent shared memory that is physically
                 distributed across the machine). We find that our
                 version of UNIX accounts for 24\% of the workload's
                 total execution time. A surprisingly large fraction of
                 OS time (79\%) is spent on memory system stalls,
                 divided equally between instruction and data cache miss
                 time. In analyzing techniques to reduce instruction
                 cache miss stall time, we find that replication of only
                 7\% of the OS code would allow 80\% of instruction
                 cache misses to be serviced locally on a CC-NUMA
                 machine. For data cache misses, we find that a small
                 number of routines account for 96\% of OS data cache
                 stall time. We find that most of these misses are
                 coherence (communication) misses, and larger caches
                 will not necessarily help. After presenting detailed
                 performance data, we analyze the benefits of several OS
                 changes and predict the effects of altering the cache
                 configuration, degree of clustering, and cache
                 coherence mechanism of the machine. (This paper is

  abstract =     "This article presents a comparative study of the
                 performance of three operating systems that run on the
                 personal computer architecture derived form the IBM-PC.
                 The operating systems, Windows for Workgroups, Windows
                 NT, and NetBSD (a freely available variant of the UNIX
                 operating system), cover a broad range of system
                 functionality and user requirements, from a
                 single-address-space model to full protection with
                 preemptive multitasking. Our measurements are enable by
                 hardware counters in Intel's Pentium processor that
                 permit measurement of a broad range of processor events
                 including instruction counts and on-chip cache miss
                 counts. We use both microbenchmarks, which expose
                 specific difference between the systems, and
                 application workloads, which provide an indication of
                 expected end-to-end performance. Our microbenchmark
                 results show that accessing system functionality is
                 often more expensive in Windows for Workgroups than in
                 the other two systems due to frequent changes in
                 machine mode and the use of system call hooks. When
                 running native applications, Windows NT is more
                 efficient than Windows, but it incurs overhead similar
                 to that of a microkernel, since its application
                 interface (the Win32 API) is implemented as a
                 user-level server. Overall, system functionality can be
                 accessed most efficiently in NetBSD; we attribute this
                 to its monolithic structure and to the absence of the
                 complications created by hardware
                 backward-compatibility requirements in the other
                 systems. Measurements of application performance show
                 that although the impact of these differences is
                 significant in terms of instruction counts and other
                 hardware events (often a factor of 2 to 7 difference
                 between the systems), overall performance is sometimes
                 determined by the functionality provided by specific
                 subsystems, such as the graphics subsystem or the file
                 system buffer cache.",

  abstract =     "This article presents the deign and implementation of
                 the recovery scheme in Calypso. Calypso is a
                 cluster-optimized, distributed file system for UNIX
                 clusters. As in Sprite and AFS, Calypso servers are
                 stateful and scale well to a large number of clients.
                 The recovery scheme in Calypso is nondisruptive,
                 meaning that open files remain open, client modified
                 data are saved, and in-flight operations are properly
                 handled across server recover. The scheme uses
                 distributed state amount the clients to reconstruct the
                 server state on a backup node if disks are multiported
                 or on the rebooted server node. It guarantees data
                 consistency during recovery and provides congestion
                 control. Measurements show that the state
                 reconstruction can be quite fast: for example, in a
                 32-node cluster, when an average node contains state
                 for about 420 files, the reconstruction time is about
                 3.3 seconds. However, the time to update a file system
                 after a failure can be a major factor in the overall
                 recovery time, even when using journaling techniques.",

                 from the unit-normal and unit-exponential distributions

                 not rely on a source of uniform random numbers, but
                 generate the target distributions directly by using
                 their maximal-entropy properties. The algorithms are
                 fast. The normal generator is faster than the commonly
                 used Unix library uniform generator ``random'' when the
                 latter is used to yield real values. Their statistical
                 properties seem satisfactory, but only a limited suite
                 of tests has been conducted. They are written in C and
                 as written assume 32-bit integer arithmetic. The code
                 is publicly available as C source and can easily be
                 adopted for longer word lengths and/or vector

                 networks of workstations. We address the question of
                 whether preemptive migration (migrating active
                 processes) is necessary, or whether remote execution
                 (migrating processes only at the time of birth) is
                 sufficient for load balancing. We show that resolving
                 this issue is strongly tied to understanding the
                 process lifetime distribution. Our measurements
                 indicate that the distribution of lifetimes for a UNIX
                 process is Pareto (heavy-tailed), with a consistent
                 functional form over a variety of workloads. We show
                 how to apply this distribution to derive a preemptive
                 migration policy that requires no hand-tuned
                 parameters. We used a trace-driven simulation to show
                 that our preemptive migration strategy is far more
                 effective than remote execution, even when the memory
                 transfer cost is high.",

                 The current trend toward open, extensible, and
                 distributed multiuser hypermedia systems adds
                 additional complexity to the development process. As a
                 means of reducing this complexity, there has been an
                 increasing interest in hyperbase management systems
                 that allow hypermedia system developers to abstract
                 from the intricacies and complexity of the hyperbase
                 layer and fully attend to application and user
                 interface issues. Design, development, and deployment
                 experiences of a dynamic, open, and distributed
                 multiuser hypermedia system development environment
                 called Hyperform is presented. Hyperform is based on
                 the concepts of extensibility, tailorability, and rapid
                 prototyping of hypermedia system services. Open,
                 extensible hyperbase management systems permit
                 hypermedia system developers to tailor hypermedia
                 functionality for specific applications and to serve as
                 a platform for research. The Hyperform development
                 environment is comprised of multiple instances of four
                 component types: (1) a hyperbase management system
                 server, (2) a tool integrator, (3) editors, and (4)
                 participating tools. Hyperform has been deployed in
                 Unix environments, and experiments have shown that
                 Hyperform greatly reduces the effort required to
                 provide customized hyperbase management system support
                 for distributed multiuser hypermedia systems.",

  abstract =     "In this article we show how to extend a wide range of
                 functionality of standard operation systems completely
                 at the user level. Our approach works by intercepting
                 selected system calls at the user level, using tracing
                 facilities such as the /proc file system provided by
                 many Unix operating systems. The behavior of some
                 intercepted system calls is then modified to implement
                 new functionality. This approach does not require any
                 relinking or recompilation of existing applications. In
                 fact, the extensions can even be dynamically
                 ``installed'' into already running processes. The
                 extensions work completely at the user level and
                 install without system administrator assistance.
                 Individual users can choose what extensions to run, in
                 effect creating a personalized operating system view
                 for themselves. We used this approach to implement a
                 global file system, called Ufo, which allows users to
                 treat remote files exactly as if they were local.
                 Currently, Ufo supports file access through the FTP and
                 HTTP protocols and allows new protocols to be plugged
                 in. While several other projects have implemented
                 global file system abstractions, they all require
                 either changes to the operating system or modifications
                 to standard libraries. The article gives a detailed
                 performance analysis of our approach to extending the
                 OS and establishes that Ufo introduces acceptable
                 overhead for common applications even though
                 intercepting individual system calls incurs a high
                 cost.",

                 realized by monitor frameworks for two very different
                 programming language implementations. Monitor
                 performance under Alamo is quite attractive when the
                 available static and dynamic means of reducing the
                 number of reported events are employed. However, Alamo
                 architecture has no support for real-time or
                 shared-memory multiprocessor-based parallel
                 applications.",

  abstract =     "Just a few years ago, personal computers (PCs) were
                 networked together in their own little islands using
                 network services such as NetWare and LAN Manager to
                 share printers and files. As these islands grew in
                 size, administrators were appointed to take care of
                 them. At the time, these administrators only needed to
                 be concerned with the PC network protocols being used
                 within their departments.\par

                 With the introduction of Windows NT, a new class of PC
                 servers began to emerge. Instead of just providing file
                 and print services, other services such as email and
                 database applications were provided on PC servers
                 running the Windows NT operating system. PC servers
                 were no longer separate islands and began making their
                 way into the datacenter.\par

                 Unix servers, on the other hand, grew up in the
                 datacenter as many mainframe functions were offloaded
                 to UNIX servers. These UNIX servers were administered
                 by trained UNIX administrators who had little contact
                 with PC server administrators.\par

                 The arrival of PC servers in the datacenter heralded
                 the arrival of the PC server administrators. Since
                 maintaining two different system administration
                 organizations is expensive, the trend in IT departments
                 is to cross-train the staff. This may seem like a
                 formidable task. However, with a little guidance,
                 experienced PC server administrators can leverage what
                 they know about Windows NT.\par

                 Specifically, the Solaris Guide for Windows NT
                 Administrators BluePrint covers: \begin{itemize} \item
                 Understanding Solaris User Account Management \item
                 Service and Task Management \item TCP/IP Administration
                 \item File Sharing Administration \item Printer
                 Administration \item Email Administration \item Web
                 Services Administration \end{itemize}",

                 system barely met the requirements of a typical
                 application. This created a trend to use a large number
                 of smaller systems, each running their own discrete
                 application. Each system managed its own resources for
                 its application. Today, however, the typical server is
                 many times larger, so we often encourage running
                 multiple applications on each system. Unix is a
                 timeshare operating system and attempts to distribute
                 the resources it manages among the applications which
                 it hosts. However, the distribution of these resources
                 does not always align with the requirements of a given
                 application. This often means that required service and
                 performance levels are not met due to conflicting
                 requirements for the same resources.",

                 of libraries to establish interoperability between
                 dissimilar computer systems can be clarified by an
                 understanding of the background and evolution of the
                 issue. The International Standards Organization
                 developed a model to link dissimilar computers, and
                 this model has evolved into consensus standards. The
                 American library community has also developed a
                 standard for interoperability, referred to as Z39.50.
                 An operating system called Unix, developed by AT and T,
                 is often specified as the system that can handle future
                 software. Although there are benefits to the standard
                 Unix, it is less efficient than some proprietary
                 systems, and it lacks networking standards. Today
                 computer manufacturers are beginning to make sure that
                 their operating systems will comply with the new
                 Portable Operating System Information Exchange (POSIX),
                 a new standard developed by the U.S. government.
                 Although librarians have already established a standard
                 for interoperability, care must be taken to insure that
                 vendors comply with the standard. It is concluded that
                 the library's focus should be on linking systems
                 without becoming too concerned about the operating
                 system that a particular system uses. A list of CISC-
                 and RISC-based hardware and compatible operating system
                 software is appended, and a glossary is provided.

                 planners are obtaining the vital information they need
                 to plan and implement an enterprise-capable PC NetLink
                 Software system.\par

                 Solaris PC NetLink Software is the latest offering from
                 Sun to enable Sun servers to support PC Client
                 services. Solaris servers, with PC NetLink Software
                 installed, not only support both the file and print
                 services that are common to all Microsoft PC operating
                 systems, but also allow Sun Workgroup and Enterprise
                 servers to be fully integrated into NT Domains as a
                 Primary, or Backup Domain Controller (PDC, BDC). In
                 addition, PC NetLink Software offers the benefit of
                 allowing NT system administrators to manage PC NetLink
                 Software systems using the same tools they already use
                 to set up and maintain NT servers.\par

                 The purpose of this book is to supply system planners
                 and system administrators the information that allows
                 them to install, tune and use their PC NetLink Software
                 to its maximum functionality and performance. Server
                 sizing information is supplied for system planners to
                 scale their PC NetLink Software to their own PC Client
                 environment.",

                 architecture. The book includes case studies, a

                 backup/restore architecture, criteria for selecting
                 tools and technologies, and tradeoffs that must be

                 optimization of computationally intensive programs on
                 Sun UltraSPARC platforms. It is primarily intended for
                 developers of technical or high performance computing
                 (HPC) applications for the Solaris operating
                 environment. This audience includes both independent
                 software vendor (ISV) developers and noncommercial
                 developers. It can also be used by end-users of HPC
                 applications to help them better understand how
                 applications utilize system resources.\par

                 The book presents information so that it follows
                 logical stages of the process for application
                 development and optimization. Authors Garg and Shapov
                 pay special attention to issues related to parallel
                 applications and to using appropriate performance
                 measurement tools. Wherever applicable, sections are
                 illustrated with code examples that show benefits of
                 methods described.\par

                 Unless otherwise noted, topics in this book are not
                 limited to a particular programming language,
                 parallelization method, software version, or hardware
                 product. However, emphasis is on techniques relevant to
                 applications written in Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C,
                 because these languages are most commonly used in HPC
                 and technical applications. Most topics can be applied
                 to C++ programs; however, the authors do not address
                 performance optimization issues specific to
                 object-oriented programming.",

                 improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices
                 have been added. You'll learn what conditions bring out
                 Linux's best performance, and how it meets the

                 high network throughput but are able to achieve only a
                 small fraction of the available bandwidth. A common
                 cause of this problem is improperly tuned network
                 settings. Tuning techniques, such as setting the
                 correct TCP buffers and using parallel streams, are
                 well known in the networking community, but outside the
                 networking community they are infrequently applied. In
                 this paper, we describe a tuning daemon that uses TCP
                 instrumentation data from the Unix kernel to
                 transparently tune TCP parameters for specified
                 individual flows over designated paths. No
                 modifications are required to the application, and the
                 user does not need to understand network or TCP
                 characteristics.",

                 scientific research, ``Data Reservoir''; which is
                 optimized to transfer huge amount of data files between
                 distant places fully utilizing multi-gigabit backbone
                 network. In addition, ``Data Reservoir'' can be used as
                 an ordinary UNIX server in local network without any
                 modification of server software. We use low-level
                 protocol and hierarchical striping to realize (1)
                 separation of bulk data transfer and local accesses by
                 caching, (2) file-system transparency, i.e.,
                 interoperable whatever in higher layer than disk
                 driver, including file system. (3) scalability for
                 network and storage. This paper shows our design,
                 implementation using iSCSI protocol [1] and their
                 performances for both 1Gbps model in the real network

                 tricks used in the kernel. The book has been updated to
                 cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite
                 different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system
                 is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is
                 improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices
                 have been added. You'll learn what conditions bring out
                 Linux's best performance, and how it meets the
                 challenge of providing good system response during
                 process scheduling, file access, and memory management

  abstract =     "We have designed and implemented the Google File
                 System, a scalable distributed file system for large
                 distributed data-intensive applications. It provides
                 fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity
                 hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to
                 a large number of clients.\par

                 While sharing many of the same goals as previous
                 distributed file systems, our design has been driven by
                 observations of our application workloads and
                 technological environment, both current and
                 anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some
                 earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to
                 reexamine traditional choices and explore radically
                 different design points.\par

                 The file system has successfully met our storage needs.
                 It is widely deployed within Google as the storage
                 platform for the generation and processing of data used
                 by our service as well as research and development
                 efforts that require large data sets. The largest
                 cluster to date provides hundreds of terabytes of
                 storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand
                 machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds
                 of clients.\par

                 In this paper, we present file system interface
                 extensions designed to support distributed
                 applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and
                 report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real
                 world use.",

                 performance contributions. These optimizations combined

                 processing (OLTP) performance and have been implemented
                 in the Intel C/C++ Itanium compiler. In particular, the

                 advantage of the Itanium register stack, proposes an

  abstract =     "The HP-UX libm library provides mathematical functions
                 for C, C++, and Fortran 90. The HP-UX libm library and
                 compilers for Itanium-based systems provide a leading
                 combination of functionality, quality, and
                 performance.With inlining and software pipelining,
                 commonly used math functions can achieve throughput
                 comparable to hand-tuned vector routines without
                 requiring user code to be written for a vector
                 interface, and with no loss of accuracy or edge-case
                 behavior: For example, the single precision exponential
                 can exceed 400 million evaluations per second on a 1.5
                 GHz Itanium 2 system. The math API encompasses C99,
                 X/Open, and other popular functionality and offers four
                 fully supported IEEE floating types. The libm library
                 and compilers provide features that facilitate
                 programming techniques that have not been practical
                 heretofore. The libm implementation for Itanium-based
                 systems, introduced in 2001 in HP-UX B.11.20 (11i
                 v1.5), has been upgraded in B.11.22 (11i v1.6), B.11.23
                 (11i v2), and most recently in B.11.23 AR1204 and the
                 associated Math Library Cumulative Patch PHSS_31853
                 with improved performance and overall quality and with
                 a few new functions. The AR1204 compilers are available
                 as patches for B.11.22; the associated Math patch for
                 B.11.22 is PHSS_32066. This paper (1) describes the
                 latest libm library (including sequences the compilers
                 inline) in terms of functionality, speed, accuracy,
                 standards, and special-case behavior; (2) discusses
                 programming techniques that exploit the floating-point
                 capabilities of HP-UX on Itanium- based systems; and
                 (3) describes motivations, goals, and development
                 strategies for the libm library and the compiler
                 floating-point facilities.",

  abstract =     "wonglediff is a program that tests the sensitivity of
                 arbitrary program executables or processes to changes
                 that are introduced by a process that runs in parallel.
                 On Unix and Linux kernels, wonglediff creates a
                 supervisor process that runs applications and, on the
                 fly, introduces desired changes to their process state.
                 When execution terminates, it then summarizes the
                 resulting changes in the output files. The technique
                 employed has a variety of uses. This paper describes an
                 implementation of wonglediff that checks the
                 sensitivity of programs to random changes in the
                 floating-point rounding modes. It runs a program
                 several times, wongling it each time: randomly toggling
                 the IEEE-754 rounding mode of the program as it
                 executes. By comparing the resulting output, one gets a
                 poor man's numerical stability analysis for the
                 program. Although the analysis does not give any kind
                 of guarantee about a program's stability, it can reveal
                 genuine instability, and it does serve as a
                 particularly useful and revealing idiot light. In our
                 implementation, differences among the output files from
                 the program's multiple runs are summarized in a report.
                 This report is in fact an HTML version of the output
                 file, with inline mark-up summarizing individual
                 differences among the multiple instances. When viewed
                 with a browser, the differences can be highlighted or
                 rendered in many different ways.",

  abstract =     "We present a Boyer--Moore (BM) approach to string
                 matching over LZ78 and LZW compressed text. The idea is
                 to search the text directly in compressed form instead
                 of decompressing and then searching it. We modify the
                 BM approach so as to skip text using the characters
                 explicitly represented in the LZ78\slash LZW formats,
                 modifying the basic technique where the algorithm can
                 choose which characters to inspect. We present and
                 compare several solutions for single and multipattern
                 searches. We show that our algorithms obtain speedups
                 of up to 50\% compared to the simple
                 decompress-then-search approach. Finally, we present a
                 public tool, LZgrep, which uses our algorithms to offer
                 grep-like capabilities directly searching files
                 compressed using Unix's Compress, an LZW compressor.
                 LZgrep can also search files compressed with Unix gzip,
                 using new decompress-then-search techniques we develop,
                 which are faster than the current tools. This way,
                 users can always keep their files in compressed form
                 and still search them, uncompressing only when they
                 want to see them.",

                 creating advanced visual effects, strategies for
                 managing complex scenes, and techniques for advanced
                 image processing. Readers will also learn new methods
                 for using the substantial processing power of the GPU
                 in other computationally intensive applications, such
                 as scientific computing and finance. Twenty of the
                 book's forty-eight chapters are devoted to GPGPU

  abstract =     "In name and in practice, the World-Wide Web (hereafter
                 Web) is used around the World beyond English-speaking
                 areas. This creates a tremendous need to
                 internationalize standard terminology used in the
                 technologies that make the Web possible. Existing
                 efforts on XML internationalization (i18n) and
                 localization (i10n) have focused on the content of XML
                 documents instead of the terms used in markup
                 (annotations) such as elements and attributes. The SGML
                 standard ISO 8879 supports the use of Unicode (ISO
                 10646) throughout a document, including markups.
                 However, most elements and attributes of XML documents
                 are still defined in English, thereby limiting their
                 use among non-English speakers. This paper presents an
                 XSLT-based method that can completely localize the
                 markup of XML documents into different natural
                 languages. We also describe how the proposed technique
                 can be applied to translation problems in programming
                 (e.g. C and Java) or documentation (e.g. \LaTeX{} or
                 other formatting languages) so that a program or a
                 document can be converted to and from an XML format",

  abstract =     "Cryptographic transformations are a fundamental
                 building block in many security applications and
                 protocols. To improve performance, several vendors
                 market hardware accelerator cards. However, until now
                 no operating system provided a mechanism that allowed
                 both uniform and efficient use of this new type of
                 resource. We present the OpenBSD Cryptographic
                 Framework (OCF), a service virtualization layer
                 implemented inside the operating system kernel, that
                 provides uniform access to accelerator functionality by
                 hiding card-specific details behind a carefully
                 designed API. We evaluate the impact of the OCF in a
                 variety of benchmarks, measuring overall system
                 performance, application throughput and latency, and
                 aggregate throughput when multiple applications make
                 use of it. We conclude that the OCF is extremely
                 efficient in utilizing cryptographic accelerator
                 functionality, attaining 95\% of the theoretical peak
                 device performance and over 800 Mbps aggregate
                 throughput using 3DES. We believe that this validates
                 our decision to opt for ease of use by applications and
                 kernel components through a uniform API and for
                 seamless support for new accelerators. Furthermore, our
                 evaluation points to several bottlenecks in system and
                 operating system design: data copying between user and
                 kernel modes, PCI bus signaling inefficiency, protocols
                 that use small data units, and single-threaded
                 applications. We identify some of these limitations
                 through a set of measurements focusing on
                 application-layer cryptographic protocols such as SSL.
                 We offer several suggestions for improvements and
                 directions for future work. We provide experimental
                 evidence of the effectiveness of a new approach which
                 we call operating system shortcutting. Shortcutting can
                 improve the performance of application-layer
                 cryptographic protocols by 27\% with very small changes
                 to the kernel.",

  abstract =     "The Linux operating system is quickly becoming a
                 standard, attracting a wide user community and
                 supporting a broad variety of applications and devices.
                 Other vendors, such as Sun, have provided
                 Linux-compatible system call interfaces to their
                 kernels, but are constrained by the lack of device
                 support. To address this problem, we present a system
                 (called PITS) to build device drivers, in this case for
                 Solaris x86, from Linux source code. To accomplish this
                 goal, we designed tools and Linux kernel emulation code
                 to handle the myriad incompatibilities. These
                 incompatibilities require the ability to resolve symbol
                 conflicts, emulate internal Linux kernel data
                 structures, handle module initialization, and generate
                 module dependencies. With our method, we show that
                 converting Linux device drivers is possible, but has a
                 few technical difficulties. Issues arise with sparse
                 documentation, external user interfaces, and modular
                 driver implementations. There are also fundamental
                 differences between the two operating systems, such as
                 interrupt and DMA handling. We describe each of these
                 issues and their current solutions to build a
                 functional driver in the Solaris environment. Using the
                 IOzone file system benchmark, we also demonstrate
                 comparable performance between our generated SCSI
                 driver set and their corresponding native
                 counterparts.",

                 make up over 70\% of the source code. Driver code is
                 also heavily dependent on the rest of the OS, for
                 functions and data structures defined in the kernel and
                 driver support libraries. These properties pose a
                 significant problem for OS evolution, as any changes in
                 the interfaces exported by the kernel and driver
                 support libraries can trigger a large number of
                 adjustments in dependent drivers. These adjustments,
                 which we refer to as collateral evolutions, may be
                 complex, entailing substantial code reorganizations. As
                 to our knowledge there exist no tools to help in this
                 process, collateral evolution is thus time consuming
                 and error prone. In this paper, we present a
                 qualitative and quantitative assessment of collateral
                 evolution in Linux device driver code. We provide a
                 taxonomy of evolutions and collateral evolutions, and
                 use an automated patch-analysis tool that we have
                 developed to measure the number of evolutions and
                 collateral evolutions that affect device drivers
                 between Linux versions 2.2 and 2.6. In particular, we
                 find that from one version of Linux to the next,
                 collateral evolutions can account for up to 35\% of the
                 lines modified in such code.",

                 actions required to secure a Linux host. Publicly
                 available resources were used to develop the exercises,
                 which have been successfully utilized since spring 2003
                 to teach cybersecurity basics classes. The experiences
                 and challenges encountered in teaching the course and

  abstract =     "Administrators often prefer to keep related sets of
                 files in different locations or media, as it is easier
                 to maintain them separately. Users, however, prefer to
                 see all files in one location for convenience. One
                 solution that accommodates both needs is virtual
                 namespace unification---providing a merged view of
                 several directories without physically merging them.
                 For example, namespace unification can merge the
                 contents of several CD-ROM images without unpacking
                 them, merge binary directories from different packages,
                 merge views from several file servers, and more.
                 Namespace unification can also enable snapshotting by
                 marking some data sources read-only and then utilizing
                 copy-on-write for the read-only sources. For example,
                 an OS image may be contained on a read-only CD-ROM
                 image---and the user's configuration, data, and
                 programs could be stored in a separate read-write
                 directory. With copy-on-write unification, the user
                 need not be concerned about the two disparate file
                 systems. It is difficult to maintain Unix semantics
                 while offering a versatile namespace unification
                 system. Past efforts to provide such unification often
                 compromised on the set of features provided or Unix
                 compatibility---resulting in an incomplete solution
                 that users could not use. We designed and implemented a
                 versatile namespace unification system called Unionfs.
                 Unionfs maintains Unix semantics while offering
                 advanced namespace unification features: dynamic
                 insertion and removal of namespaces at any point in the
                 merged view, mixing read-only and read-write
                 components, efficient in-kernel duplicate elimination,
                 NFS interoperability, and more. Since releasing our
                 Linux implementation, it has been used by thousands of
                 users and over a dozen Linux distributions, which
                 helped us discover and solve many practical problems.",

                 to expensive code size overhead when it is used in the
                 embedded market. To overcome this problem, we propose
                 the application of link-time compaction and
                 specialization techniques that exploit the a priori
                 known, fixed runtime environment of many embedded
                 systems. In experimental setups based on the ARM XScale
                 and i386 platforms, the proposed techniques are able to
                 reduce the kernel memory footprint with over 16\%. We
                 also show how relatively simple additions to existing
                 binary rewriters can implement the proposed techniques
                 for a complex, very unconventional program, such as the
                 Linux kernel. We note that even after specialization, a
                 lot of seemingly unnecessary code remains in the kernel
                 and propose to reduce the footprint of this code by
                 applying code-compression techniques. This technique,
                 combined with the previous ones, reduces the memory
                 footprint with over 23\% for the i386 platform and 28\%
                 for the ARM platform. Finally, we pinpoint an important
                 code size growth problem when compaction and
                 compression techniques are combined on the ARM
                 platform.",

                 transformations for operating system (OS)-driven
                 embedded software programs to reduce their energy
                 consumption. Their key features include spanning of
                 process boundaries and minimization of the energy
                 consumed in the execution of OS
                 services---opportunities which are beyond the reach of
                 conventional compiler optimizations and source code
                 transformations. We have applied the proposed
                 transformations to several multiprocess benchmark
                 programs in the context of an embedded Linux OS running
                 on an Intel StrongARM processor. They achieve up to
                 37.9\% (23.8\%, on average) energy reduction compared
                 to highly compiler-optimized implementations.",

  abstract =     "In many workloads, most write operations performed on
                 a file system modify only a small number of blocks. The
                 log-structured file system was designed for such a
                 workload, additionally with the aim of fast crash
                 recovery and system snapshots. Surprisingly, although
                 implemented for Berkeley Sprite and BSD systems, there
                 was no complete implementation for the current Linux
                 kernel. In this paper, we present a complete
                 implementation of the log-structured file system for
                 the Linux kernel, which includes a user-space garbage
                 collector and additional tools. We evaluate the
                 measurements obtained in several test cases and compare
                 the results with widely-used ext3.",

                 design decisions on the performance of TxLinux. TxLinux
                 is a Linux kernel modified to use transactions in place
                 of locking primitives in several key subsystems. We run
                 TxLinux on MetaTM, which is a new hardware-transaction
                 memory (HTM) model. MetaTM contains features that
                 enable efficient and correct interrupt handling for an
                 x86-like architecture. Live stack overwrites can
                 corrupt non-transactional stack memory and requires a
                 small change to the transaction register checkpoint
                 hardware to ensure correct operation of the operating
                 system. We also propose stack based early release to
                 reduce spurious conflicts on stack memory between
                 kernel code and interrupt handlers. We use MetaTM to
                 examine the performance sensitivity of individual
                 architectural features. For TxLinux we find that Polka
                 and SizeMatters are effective contention management
                 policies, some form of backoff on transaction
                 contention is vital for performance,and stalling on a
                 transaction conflict reduces transaction restart rates,
                 but does not improve performance. Transaction write
                 sets are small, and performance is insensitive to
                 transaction abort costs but sensitive to commit
                 costs.",

  abstract =     "TxLinux is a variant of Linux that is the first
                 operating system to use hardware transactional memory
                 (HTM) as a synchronization primitive, and the first to
                 manage HTM in the scheduler. This paper describes and
                 measures TxLinux and discusses two innovations in
                 detail: cooperation between locks and transactions, and
                 the integration of transactions with the OS scheduler.
                 Mixing locks and transactions requires a new primitive,
                 cooperative transactional spinlocks (cxspinlocks) that
                 allow locks and transactions to protect the same data
                 while maintaining the advantages of both
                 synchronization primitives. Cxspinlocks allow the
                 system to attempt execution of critical regions with
                 transactions and automatically roll back to use locking
                 if the region performs I/O. Integrating the scheduler
                 with HTM eliminates priority inversion. On a series of
                 real-world benchmarks TxLinux has similar performance
                 to Linux, exposing concurrency with as many as 32
                 concurrent threads on 32 CPUs in the same critical
                 region.",

                 (network control program) software that runs on them,
                 have been at the center of the IBM SNA (Systems Network
                 Architecture) for many years. However, the 374x
                 hardware is no longer being produced. In order to
                 continue to offer IBM customers various functions
                 provided by the NCP product, IBM has developed a
                 Communication Controller for Linux (CCL) for the IBM
                 System z. CCL is a software program that emulates the
                 374x hardware, enabling the NCP to function in Linux.
                 IBM customers now have the ability to migrate their NCP
                 product to a Linux partition on System z. The current
                 NCP product, running on an IBM 374x Communication
                 Controller, supports both host channel and network
                 attachment. The channel protocol used for the
                 host-channel support is referred to as channel data
                 link control (CDLC). In order to provide the System z9e
                 host operating systems with the ability to attach to
                 the new CCL NCP over a channel interface, a new channel
                 adapter is required. The new innovative Open Systems
                 Adapter for NCP (OSN) channel support provided by the
                 OSA-Express2 allows various operating systems on the
                 same System z9 to attach ``internally'' to the CCL
                 without using any external network or channel fabric.",

                 captured the interest of many thousands of developers
                 and millions of users. It recently celebrated its 16th
                 anniversary, includes many millions of lines of code,
                 and is used in production systems around the world. It

                 [3] [4], including the employment of many core kernel

                 way kernel-provided resources are accessed by

                 IDs and SYSV shared messages, have traditionally been
                 identified using global tables. Since 2005, these
                 tables have gradually been transformed into per-process
                 namespaces in order to support both resource
                 availability on application restart and virtual private
                 server functionality. Due to inherent differences in
                 the resources themselves, the semantics of namespace
                 cloning differ for many of the resources. This paper

                 Linux 2.6 that increases I/O throughput and adds
                 support for heterogeneous parallel processors by (1)
                 collapsing many I/O interfaces onto one: the Unix
                 pipeline, (2) increasing pipe efficiency and (3)
                 exploiting pipeline modularity to spread computation
                 across all available processors.\par

                 PipesFS extends the pipeline model to kernel I/O and
                 communicates with applications through a Linux virtual
                 filesystem (VFS), where directory nodes represent
                 operations and pipe nodes export live kernel data.
                 Users can thus interact with kernel I/O through
                 existing calls like mkdir, tools like grep, most
                 languages and even shell scripts. To support
                 performance critical tasks, PipesFS improves pipe
                 throughput through copy, context switch and cache miss
                 avoidance. To integrate heterogeneous processors (e.g.,
                 the Cell) it transparently moves operations to the most
                 efficient type of core.",

                 tools suffer from an {\em imperative model}, where
                 system administration actions such as upgrading
                 packages or changes to system configuration files are
                 stateful: they destructively update the state of the
                 system. This leads to many problems, such as the
                 inability to roll back changes easily, to run multiple
                 versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a
                 configuration deterministically on another machine, or
                 to reliably upgrade a system. In this paper we show
                 that we can overcome these problems by moving to a {\em
                 purely functional system configuration model}. This
                 means that all static parts of a system (such as
                 software packages, configuration files and system
                 startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are
                 immutable, stored in a way analogously to a heap in a
                 purely function language. We have implemented this
                 model in {\em NixOS}, a non-trivial Linux distribution
                 that uses the {\em Nix package manager\/} to build the

                 in-kernel readahead algorithm has been challenged by
                 many unexpected and subtle problems. To name a few:
                 readahead thrashings arise when readahead pages are
                 evicted prematurely under memory pressure; readahead
                 attempts on already cached pages are undesirable;
                 interrupted-then-retried reads and locally disordered
                 NFS reads that can easily fool the sequential detection
                 logic. In this paper, we present a new Linux readahead
                 framework with flexible and robust heuristics that can
                 cover varied sequential I/O patterns. It also enjoys
                 great simplicity by handling most abnormal cases in an
                 implicit way. We demonstrate its advantages by a host
                 of case studies. Network throughput is 3 times better
                 in the case of thrashing and 1.8 times better for large
                 NFS files. On serving large files with lighttpd, the
                 disk utilization is decreased by 26\% while providing
                 17\% more network throughput.",

                 cases, if the application is compromised while running
                 as a privileged user, the entire system can become
                 vulnerable. An alternative approach is taken by the
                 Plan 9 operating system from Bell Labs, which runs such
                 applications as a non-privileged user and relies on a
                 kernel-based capability device working in coordination
                 with an authentication server to provide the same
                 services. This avoids the risk of an application
                 vulnerability becoming a system vulnerability.\par

                 This paper discusses the extension of Linux
                 authentication mechanisms to allow the use of the Plan
                 9 approach with existing Linux applications in order to
                 reduce the security risks mentioned earlier. It
                 describes the port of the Plan 9 capability device as a
                 character device driver for the Linux kernel. It also
                 describes the port of the Plan 9 authentication server
                 and the implementation of a PAM module which allows the
                 use of these new facilities. {\em It is now possible to
                 restrain processes like login and su from the
                 uncontrolled setuid bit and make them run on behalf of
                 an unprivileged user in Linux}.",

                 have been added to Linux\TM{} over the past ten years.
                 What is less well-known is that it is often necessary
                 to introduce a large amount of Linux into a given
                 technology in order to successfully introduce that
                 technology into Linux. This paper illustrates such an
                 introduction of Linux into technology with Read-Copy
                 Update (RCU). The RCU API's evolution over time clearly
                 shows that Linux's extremely diverse set of workloads
                 and platforms has changed RCU to a far greater degree
                 than RCU has changed Linux---and it is reasonable to
                 expect that other technologies that might be proposed
                 for inclusion into Linux would face similar challenges.
                 In addition, this paper presents a summary of lessons
                 learned and an attempt to foresee what additional
                 challenges Linux might present to RCU.",

  abstract =     "The internal libraries of Linux are evolving rapidly,
                 to address new requirements and improve performance.
                 These evolutions, however, entail a massive problem of
                 collateral evolution in Linux device drivers: for every
                 change that affects an API, all dependent drivers must
                 be updated accordingly. Manually performing such
                 collateral evolutions is time-consuming and unreliable,
                 and has lead to errors when modifications have not been
                 done consistently.\par

                 In this paper, we present an automatic program
                 transformation tool Coccinelle, for documenting and
                 automating device driver collateral evolutions. Because
                 Linux programmers are accustomed to manipulating
                 program modifications in terms of patch files, this
                 tool uses a language based on the patch syntax to
                 express transformations, extending patches to semantic
                 patches. Coccinelle preserves the coding style of the
                 original driver, as would a human programmer.\par

                 We have evaluated our approach on 62 representative
                 collateral evolutions that were previously performed
                 manually in Linux 2.5 and 2.6. On a test suite of over
                 5800 relevant driver files, the semantic patches for
                 these collateral evolutions update over 93\% of the
                 files completely. In the remaining cases, the user is
                 typically alerted to a partial match against the driver
                 code, identifying the files that must be considered
                 manually. We have additionally identified over 150
                 driver files where the maintainer made an error in
                 performing the collateral evolution, but Coccinelle
                 transforms the code correctly. Finally, several patches
                 derived from the use of Coccinelle have been accepted
                 into the Linux kernel.",

                 the CPU resources appropriately to all processes. The
                 Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) design ensures
                 fairness among tasks using the thread fair scheduling
                 algorithm. This algorithm ensures allocation of
                 resources based on the number of threads in the system
                 and not within executing programs. This can lead to
                 fairness issue in a multi-threaded environment as the
                 Linux scheduler tends to favor programs with higher
                 number of threads. We illustrate the issue of fairness
                 through experimental evaluation thus exposing the
                 weakness of the current allocation scheme where
                 software developers could take advantage by spawning
                 many additional threads in order to obtain more CPU
                 resources. A novel algorithm is proposed as a solution
                 towards achieving better fairness in the Linux
                 scheduler. The algorithm is based on weight
                 readjustment of the threads created in the same process
                 to significantly reduce the unfair allocation of CPU
                 resources in multi-threaded environments. The algorithm
                 was implemented and evaluated. It demonstrated
                 promising results towards solving the raised fairness
                 issue. We conclude this paper highlighting the

  abstract =     "UNIX turns 40 this year: many happy returns! Four
                 decades is a vast period for the computing industry:
                 systems from the 1970s now seem rudimentary and
                 primitive. And yet, the early versions of UNIX were
                 epitomes of sophisticated concepts packaged into
                 elegant systems. UNIX' influence has been so powerful
                 that it reverberates down to affect us in the 21st
                 century.\par

                 The history of the development of UNIX has been well
                 documented, and over the past decade or so, efforts
                 have been made to find and conserve the software and
                 documentation artifacts from the earliest period of
                 UNIX history. This paper details the work that has been
                 done to restore the artifacts from this time to working
                 order and the lessons learned from this work.",

  abstract =     "The SELinux mandatory access control (MAC) policy has
                 recently added a multilevel security (MLS) model which
                 is able to express a fine granularity of control over a
                 subject's access rights. The problem is that the
                 richness of the SELinux MLS model makes it impractical
                 to manually evaluate that a given policy meets certain
                 specific properties. To address this issue, we have
                 modeled the SELinux MLS model, using a logical
                 specification and implemented that specification in the
                 Prolog language. Furthermore, we have developed some
                 analyses for testing information flow properties of a
                 given policy as well as an algorithm to determine
                 whether one policy is compliant with another. We have
                 implemented these analyses in Prolog and compiled our
                 implementation into a tool for SELinux MLS policy
                 analysis, called PALMS. Using PALMS, we verified some
                 important properties of the SELinux MLS reference
                 policy, namely that it satisfies the simple security
                 condition and {\SGMLsstarf}-property defined by Bell
                 and LaPadula. We also evaluated whether the policy
                 associated to a given application is compliant with the
                 policy of the SELinux system in which it would be
                 deployed.",

  abstract =     "In 2001, Chou et al. published a study of faults found
                 by applying a static analyzer to Linux versions 1.0
                 through 2.4.1. A major result of their work was that
                 the drivers directory contained up to 7 times more of
                 certain kinds of faults than other directories. This
                 result inspired a number of development and research
                 efforts on improving the reliability of driver code.
                 Today Linux is used in a much wider range of
                 environments, provides a much wider range of services,
                 and has adopted a new development and release model.
                 What has been the impact of these changes on code
                 quality? Are drivers still a major problem?\par

                 To answer these questions, we have transported the
                 experiments of Chou et al. to Linux versions 2.6.0 to
                 2.6.33, released between late 2003 and early 2010. We
                 find that Linux has more than doubled in size during
                 this period, but that the number of faults per line of
                 code has been decreasing. And, even though drivers
                 still accounts for a large part of the kernel code and
